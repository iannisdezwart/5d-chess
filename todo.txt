Todo:
  - Optimise ChessBoardMap.update() to only update changed boards.
  - Make scrolling look smoother.
  - Create zoom feature using the mousewheel.
  - Make everything work on mobile.
  - Think about whether a pawn moving to another board can be taken en passant.
    Currently, it cannot.
  - Add move indicators for moves within the same board
  - Add arrows to indicate moves across boards.
  - Add arrows to indicate timeline branches

Doing:
  - Think about whether pawns can move two spaces into another dimension.
  - Think about whether en passant and castling can be done in
    multiple dimensions and how exactly that would work.
      => apparently the original game does not allow this.
  - Think about whether the king and queen should be able to move in any number
    of dimensions, or only in one or two dimensions.
      => in the original game, they move in any number of dimensions.

Done:
  - Allow dragging a piece to another chessboard.
  - Fix bad performance when having lots of boards.
